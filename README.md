## Description
This is a web-application which connects people with same interests. Here they can share posts like invitation to a band or game, or a post where they can ask for help or are looking for a specific person to join their hobby or to teach them and perform better. For example, a userâ€™s hobby is to play guitar and he wants to join a band where he can play with other musicians. So, he easily can do that using our application by just entering a music group and writing a post with his request.
